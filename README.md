# Enhancing-water-quality-for-open-water-bodies-using-satellite-imagery
we used Google earth engine for fetching the data from satellite. We used two satellite dataset that are sentinel and landsat to create our dataset. 

Secondly we have converted the imagery data to data frames using python library pandas .

Then we have built our models for training and we have used satellite dataset on those models for training. The models we have used are SVM(support vector machine), Random forest. 

Thirdly, we have created a predictor for water test results that help in building a gui which generates the output. the user have to input the values of the parameters mentioned on the interface. Finally user will get the output.
